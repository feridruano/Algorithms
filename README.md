# Data Structures and Algorithms

Teaching myself Data Structure and Algorithms with a focus on concepts rather dishing out implementations. Although, I write down my thoughts and breakdown the concepts on scratch paper most of time. So, this repository mainly contains code and I plan on adding more markdowns soon.

**Edit:** I started adding more markdowns after each reading by practicing my recall and fixing any mistakes or answering any questions by looking back at the books.

## List of Books

- [x] Computer Science Distilled 
  - Great overview of computer science. Took no notes.

- [x] Grokking Algorithms
  - Too basic and not interesting enough. Did not want to finish the book.

- [ ] A Common-Sense Guide to Data Structures and Algorithms
  - Well structured and a great breakdown of the concepts for beginners.

- [ ] Introduction to Algorithms (CLRS)
  - Best book for understanding the analysis of algorithms.
