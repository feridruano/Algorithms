# Stacks

An **data structure** with the constraint of inserting, deleting or reading a value at the end of the array. This restriction classifies Stacks as a **Last-In-First-Out (LIFO)** data structure. Rather than focusing on data storage, a Stack's objective is data processing as the LIFO restriction provides a new mental model for tackling problems.

## Terminology

**Top** - The end of the array. Usually, refers to viewing an array vertically instead of horizontally.

**Bottom** - The beginning of the array. Usually, refers to viewing an array vertically instead of horizontally.

**Push** - Inserting a value to the top of the stack.

**Pop** - Deleting a value from the top of the stack.

**Read** - Reading the value at the top of the stack.
