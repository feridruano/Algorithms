# Data Structures and Algorithms

Teaching myself Data Structure and Algorithms with a focus on concepts rather dishing out implementations. Although, I write down my thoughts and breakdowns of the concepts on scratch paper most of time. So, this repository mainly contains code and I plan on adding more markdowns soon.

## List of Books

1. Computer Science Distilled
    - Great Overview of Computer Science
2. Grokking Algorithms
    - Too Basic and Not Interesting
3. A Common-Sense Guide to Data Structures and Algorithms
    - Well structured and great breakdown of the concepts.
3. Introduction to Algorithms (CLRS)
    - Soon...
