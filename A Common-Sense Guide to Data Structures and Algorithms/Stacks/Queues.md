# Queues

An **data structure** with the constraint of inserting a value at the end of the array or deleting or reading a value from the beginning of the array. This restriction classifies Queues as a **First-In-First-Out (FIFO)** data structure. Rather than focusing on data storage, a Queue's objective is data processing as the FIFO restriction provides a new mental model for tackling problems.

## Terminology

**Front** - The beginning of the array. 

**End** - The end of the array.

**Enqueue** - Inserting a value to the end of the queue.

**Dequeue** - Deleting a value from the front of the queue.

**Read** - Reading the value at the front of the queue.
