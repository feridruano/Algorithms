## About

A repository of notes and python implementations of exercises from <u>*A Common-Sense Guide to Data Structures and Algorithms, Second Edition.*</u> All notes and implementations are used as a draft or scratch paper to conceptually think through what is learned. This process involves reading a chapter without notes, writing down notes based on recall, and then fixing any mistakes or answering any questions by looking through the chapter.

For any beginners learning Data Structure and Algorithms, I highly recommended this book! Plus, it's a great introduction into Time Complexity (Big Oh) without the intimating mathematical concepts.

**Bookmark:** I left off at Binary Trees because my algorithm class started and uses *<u>Introduction to Algorithms, Third Edition (CLRS)</u>*. Since the class can't cover everything in the CLRS within the time frame of the semester, I plan on finishing this book before I finish reading the remaining chapters of the CLRS after the semester ends.

**Goal:** At the end of the book, I want to implement all the main data structures and algorithms in Python by recalling what I learned and working the algorithms.
